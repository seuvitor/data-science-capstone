## Smart Typing Machine

This Shiny app was built for the Coursera/Johns Hopkins Data Science Capstone to showcase the
habilities learned in the program.

The app presents to you an "omnibox" where you can start typing, and it will help you:

- at all times it will suggest the next word
- it will autocomplete the word you are typing right now

That way you can type much faster while saving a few keystrokes.

You can also paste in some text just to check the predictions.

## Under the hood (1/2)

A simple app, but its predictions are based on a powerful 5-gram probabilistic model, built from the
Coursera/SwiftKey dataset containing thousands of tweets, blog posts and news articles.

Upon this model, we implemented a Stupid Backoff-type algorithm:

- Given the last 4 words, the algorithm looks for the most frequent 5-grams starting with such words
- If it can't find them, we use the last 3 words to predict from the 4-grams
- And so on if it keeps failing until predicting by the frequency of single words as a last resort.

## Under the hood (2/2)

We pre-computed the 5 most likely next words for each known n-gram and stored in the model, for
an improved response time in our application. Here are our results from a popular benchmark on the
discussion forums:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Overall top-3 score:     17.60 %
Overall top-1 precision: 13.18 %
Overall top-3 precision: 21.47 %
Average runtime:         27.07 msec
Number of predictions:   28464
Total memory used:       1.38 MB
